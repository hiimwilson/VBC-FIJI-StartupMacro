# VBC-FIJI-StartupMacro
The startup macro for the Vanderbilt Biophotonics Center FIJI update site. It provides a GUI of shortcuts to some useful but buried FIJI commands to speed up exploratory image  analysis. Replace your 'StartupMacro.ijm' file in your FIJI macro's folder with the script in this repository and you should be good to go.
